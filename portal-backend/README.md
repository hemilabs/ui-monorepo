# Portal Backend

The portal backend is composed by an API and several cron jobs.

## API

### Routes

#### `GET /btc-vaults/:chain-id`

Provides several metrics and status information about the BTC vaults in the given Hemi chain.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/btc-vaults/743111
{"bitcoinChainData":{"bitcoin":{"height":901676},"bitcoinKit":{"height":901674,"blockHash":"0x0000000000000000000107cb02a6c19084b54a1d0e8504d3a96d8fdd10d2f62b","version":536944640,"previousBlockHash":"0x00000000000000000000a30d9d5025c11b17b2c44b176de0e284c84f59dacebb","merkleRoot":"0x05c2f62905f83beeb75131a245c1851705814d09165fdac50b74e0e4814607b2","timestamp":1750196887,"bits":386021892,"nonce":1816880925}},"tunnelManagerData":{"withdrawalsPaused":false},"vaultsData":[{"status":5,"vaultAddress":"0x3DA10b74Bd339E69C1De9408020ce640B012e8cc","balanceSats":0,"bitcoinCustodyAddress":"18AVmm853HVhibPHMc3JRLXMynzKAbj6Po","pendingWithdrawalAmountSat":0,"pendingWithdrawalCount":0},...]}
```

#### `GET /circulating`

Returns the HEMI circulating supply.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/circulating
"555000000.000000000000000000"
```

#### `GET /claims/:chain-id/:address/all`

Returns an array with the data needed for a user to claim their HEMI tokens.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/claims/43111/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001/all
[{"amount":"50000000000000000000","claimGroupId":16,"proof":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002","0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"]}]
```

The data for each claim group must be located in individual files in the `src/claims-data` folder. Data must be a object whose properties are the user addresses:

```json
{
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "amount": "50000000000000000000",
    "claimGroupId": 16,
    "proof": [
      "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
      "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
      "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that the route `GET /claims/:chain-id/:address` is kept for compatibility and will return just the first element of the array.

#### `GET /net-stats`

Returns the Hemi network stats required by the [home page of the Marketing site](https://hemi.xyz).

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/net-stats

```

#### `GET /points/:address`

Provides the amount of Hemi points any user has earned through the **Incentivized Testnet**, **Hemi Staking** campaigns, etc.
Data is provided by [Absinthe](https://absinthe.network/).

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
{"points":10000}
```

#### `GET /prices`

Retrieves token prices (in USD) stored in a key/value store.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/prices
{"prices":{"BTC":"94514.79193898945","M-BTC":"95894.52612269788","PUMPBTC":"95990.74415080296","WBTC":"95797.80677773379"},"time":"2025-02-17T23:12:35.803Z"}
```

#### `GET /tvl`

Computes and caches the TVL so the portal can have a value even if [Databox](https://databox.com/) is down or returns errors.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:3006/tvl
{"tvl":808500187.3738999}
```
